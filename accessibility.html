       <h1>Barbara Nino Carreras / accessibility</h1>
	<h2>Disability access is very important!</h2>
    <p>This website is my first exploration of HTML and CSS. I coded the website using DreamWeaver. If you encounter any access issues while browsing this website <em>please</em> email me.</p>

    <h1>Things I have done to improve the accessibility of this website </h1>
    <ol>
      <li>I have tested the site focusing on it's keyboard navigation.</li>
		<li>To check the accessibility of this site, I used the <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/extension/">Wave Evaluation Tool extension for Google Chrome</a>.</li>
		 <li>When designing the website and the structure, I took inspiration from the website <a href="https://a11yweekly.com/">Accessibility Weekly</a>.</li>
      <li>I have implemented aria labels where needed, I am in the process of understanding how to use these properly.</li>
      <li>I use alt attributes and describe all elements of images while being concise and fun.</li>
		<li>I stay humble and keep making improvements to this site as I learn more and receive feedback from visitors.</li>
		<li>I prioritize neurodivergent and blind joy over visually-dominated or overstimulating design.</li>
		<li>I think of <a href="https://disabilityvisibilityproject.com/2019/02/01/access-is-love/">access as an act of love</a> as opposed to being simply understood as a question of compliance or logistics.</li>
