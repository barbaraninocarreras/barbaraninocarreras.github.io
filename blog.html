	<h1>Visual Ethnography: While We Wait for Time to Pass (2020)</h1>
    <p>A photography project that explores Malapascua, an island in the Philippines that is 2.7 km long and 1 km wide, located north of Cebu province. The island is well-known for its diving sites that allow people to swim with thresher sharks throughout most of the year. However, during the pandemic, stories about the island's inhabitants remained untold. The project began when the World Health Organization announced the pandemic on March 11, 2020, interrupting my journey across the Philippines. These series of  portraits show different stages of the lockdown, from General Community Quarantine (GCQ) to Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ). Each portrait is accompanied by a short text that provides context to the stories shared with me by the island's residents during my stay, which took place between March 2 and May 25, 2020.</p>

 	<figcaption>Low tide in the afternoon, families walk across the shore to pick up seafood. With no incoming travellers, islanders have to reorganize their ways of living together and surviving. Their livelihood depends on tourism and daily wages.</figcaption>

 	<figcaption>The market in Malapascua is usually crowded, now it is silent. It is May, the island is transitioning from Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) to General Community Quarantine (GCQ). Karaoke or any other social gathering are forbidden until further notice.</figcaption>

 	<figcaption>On May 24, 70-year-old Josephine enjoys walking around her garden. Due to curfews, elderly residents have not been allowed to go outside since the beginning of Community Quarantine at the end of March. Relatives visit Josephine on a daily basis. They bring her food and keep her company. Most recently, a hummingbird has built a nest on her favourite lemon tree, which brings her immense joy every morning</figcaption>

 	<figcaption>Families in need receive help and relief goods collected by business owners. Families who own businesses on the island collaborate with government authorities to distribute kilos of rice and canned goods to families in need. Many unregistered residents on the island have no government support or access to healthcare. Through Facebook, residents in need reach out to business owners and ask for specific products such as infant formula or canned fish.</figcaption>

 	<figcaption>On my last day on the island, I asked Jon Jon, musician and owner of Villa Sandra Guest House, if I could take a photo of him. During the lockdown, Jon Jon initiated feeding programs for families in need helped by volunteers at his guest house Villa Sandra. In the past years, he has been organizing medical and educational activities for children in Malapascua.</figcaption>

 	<figcaption>Stray dogs salute residents, they keep their distance and sit while they wait for food. In May 2020, residents of Malapascua, Leegal Ant, Gina De Ruyter and Logan Hayman, fundraised an animal shelter for stray dogs and cats called Malapascua Paw Heroes. With the help of social media engagements through a live-streamed concert, they received support to start curing and hosting abandoned and malnourished dogs and cats.</figcaption>

 	<figcaption> Nudi is a stray dog, she has been adopted several times, but new puppies keep on taking her place. The number of puppies on the island is continuously rising, and many of them suffer from abandonment, disease and hunger. For this reason, volunteers have been fundraising money to start an animal shelter that opened in May. Before the animal centre, caretakers of dogs and cats relied on homemade remedies and peer-to-peer advice on social media or Google to cure their companions of skin diseases and worms.</figcaption>

 	<figcaption> Bebot is the owner of a small bed and breakfast in Malapascua. Her business gives jobs to residents during enhanced community quarantine (ECQ). They serve banana pancakes and smoothies, her cat, Nutella, walks around greeting visitors. Since March, her bed and breakfast has been adapting to regulation changes which have led her to transform her business into a takeaway service on WhatsApp. Luckily, one of her guests,Davey, originally from Sweden, has been helping her to manage the bed and breakfast online.</figcaption>

 	<figcaption> Cristina and her son Hans walk around the resort. Cristina works as a housekeeper and gardener in a resort. Before the lockdown and Enhanced Community Quarantine, she was able to move to the resort with her family and practice social distancing by staying within the property areas of her workplace.</figcaption>

 	<figcaption> Plastic is everywhere in Malapascua. To cope with plastic debris, residents reuse containers as much as possible, yet everything they can afford to buy comes in plastic containers and sachets. The government has not invested in waste management infrastructure, which worsens the amount of plastic that reaches the ocean. To cope with this problem, the organisation People and the Sea has been engaging with local communities to recycle and work on waste management.</figcaption>
