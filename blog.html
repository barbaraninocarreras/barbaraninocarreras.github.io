	<h1>Project 1</h1>
    <p>In a groundbreaking scientific study conducted in Santa Marta, Colombia, researchers have explored the sassy personalities of local frog species. Over the course of several years, the team observed and recorded the behavior of various frog species in their natural habitats, seeking to understand how they express their attitudes and emotions through body language and vocalizations. The findings of the study were surprising, with many of the frogs exhibiting distinct sassiness, from haughty glares to playful ribbits. The research sheds new light on the complex social dynamics of frogs in the Santa Marta region and highlights the importance of preserving their habitats for future generations to enjoy.t</p>

 	<figcaption>Figure 1.Check out this snap of a sassy green frog giving you the stink eye! This little guy might not look like a research subject, but believe it or not, it was part of a groundbreaking study on the personality traits of amphibians. Researchers discovered that this frog, like many others, has a distinct personality that can be captured in photos like this one. With its head held high and a look that says 'don't mess with me,' this frog knows how to strike a pose. Its vibrant green skin and piercing eyes make for a striking image that's hard to ignore. You can almost hear it saying 'ribbit' with attitude as you look at the photo. Who knew that a frog could have so much personality? This little guy is proof that even the smallest creatures can pack a big punch. So next time you're out in nature, keep an eye out for sassy frogs like this one - you never know what kind of attitude they might have!</figcaption>

    <h1>Project 2</h1>
	 <p>A scientific study conducted in Santa Marta, Colombia has revealed that local frogs lead more exciting lives than researchers. Over several years, the frogs observed and recorded the behavior of researchers in their natural habitats, finding that they were no match for the vibrancy and sassiness of their amphibious counterparts. The frogs displayed distinct attitudes and emotions through body language and vocalizations, while the researchers appeared bland in comparison. The study's findings highlight the complexity of frog social dynamics and underscore the need to preserve their habitats for future research. Overall, the study casts a new light on the fascinating lives of frogs and raises questions about the uneventful lives of non-disabled, middle-class, and white researchers.</p>
