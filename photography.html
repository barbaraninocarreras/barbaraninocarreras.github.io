      <p>Visual Ethnography: While we wait for time to pass </p>

        <p>Image description: A nighttime photograph captures a man sitting alone in silence on the terrace of what appears to be a closed restaurant. A single light bulb hangs from the fabric-covered roof, casting a soft glow over the outdoor plants and a few empty plastic chairs scattered around the terrace.</p>
        <p>During the first months of the Covid-19 pandemic, I conducted fieldwork on Malapascua, a small island in the Philippines known for its diving sites where it is possible to swim alongside thresher sharks. The lockdown was sudden, and the islanders' livelihoods were compromised as tourists took emergency flights back home. As a part of the project <a href="https://deltagelsensgrammatik.itu.dk/">Hverdagens Digitalisering</a> I spent three months documenting the everyday lives of islanders and tourists who decided to stay. A series of photographs helped us tell stories about the island and its residents during this crisis.</p>

        <p>The lockdowns across the Philippines forced residents of Malapascua to stay on the island, making it impossible to move freely across the country. Jon Jon, a resident of Malapascua, organized the delivery of food to vulnerable populations in the area. He also organized creative activities, such as music workshops and arts and crafts, to support families and children on the island. Most mutual aid responses were coordinated on Facebook and WhatsApp.</p>

        <p>Residents of Malapascua who owned concrete homes on the island could safely practice social distancing and receive help from family members to access food and drinking water. This was not the case for people living in underserved areas with no basic infrastructure, whose homes were made of unstable materials such as bricks, wood, plastic, and metal. Residents in low-income areas had to travel across the island to find aid, water and fish, often joining crowds.</p>

          <p>On a weekly basis wealthy residents went for walks to deliver rice, canned good and baby formula to families in need. Each bag had a family name. The aid was coordinated on Facebook and WhatsApp. Families without access to the internet would be supported by their neighbors to request particular medicines or goods according to need.</p>
