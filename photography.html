      <p>Visual Ethnography: While we wait for time to pass </p>

        <p><strong>Image description</strong>: A nighttime photograph captures a man sitting alone in silence on the terrace of what appears to be a closed restaurant. A single light bulb hangs from the fabric-covered roof, casting a soft glow over the outdoor plants and a few empty plastic chairs scattered around the terrace.</p>
        <p>During the first months of the Covid-19 pandemic, I conducted fieldwork on Malapascua, a small island in the Philippines known for its diving sites where it is possible to swim alongside thresher sharks. The lockdown was sudden, and the islanders' livelihoods were compromised as tourists took emergency flights back home. As a part of the project <a href="https://deltagelsensgrammatik.itu.dk/">Hverdagens Digitalisering</a> I spent three months documenting the everyday lives of islanders and tourists who decided to stay. A series of photographs helped us tell stories about the island and its residents during this crisis.</p>

        <p><strong>Image description</strong>: Jon Jon, a young Filipino man with long hair, stands on the roof of his house, holding his flute aloft under the strong sun. He wears only swim trunks, revealing his bare chest and arms adorned with tribal tattoos. Behind him, palm trees sway gently, and dark clouds gather on the horizon, signaling the impending arrival of a storm.</p>
        <p>Lockdowns and quarantine measures across the Philippines forced residents of Malapascua to remain on the island, restricting their ability to move freely across the country. Jon Jon, a resident of Malapascua, organized food deliveries to vulnerable populations in the area. He also coordinated creative activities, such as music workshops and arts and crafts, to support families and children on the island. Most mutual aid responses were organized through Facebook and WhatsApp.</p>

        <p>Residents of Malapascua who owned concrete homes on the island could safely practice social distancing and receive help from family members to access food and drinking water. This was not the case for people living in underserved areas with no basic infrastructure, whose homes were made of unstable materials such as bricks, wood, plastic, and metal. Residents in low-income areas had to travel across the island to find aid, water and fish, often joining crowds.</p>

        <p><strong>Image description</strong>: The hands of three Filipino women reach out to receive plastic bags containing rice and baby formula, intended for delivery to families in need.</p>
          <p>Each week, wealthy residents took walks around the community to deliver rice, canned goods, and baby formula to families in need. Each bag was labeled with the recipient family's name, and the aid distribution was coordinated through Facebook and WhatsApp. Families without internet access received help from neighbors to request specific medicines or supplies based on their needs.</p>
