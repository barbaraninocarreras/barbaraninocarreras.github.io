      <h1>Hello, thank you for joining us today.💞</h1>
  	 <p>The presentation is 20-minutes long, Barbara will present her experimentations making comics and alt-narratives as a research method.</p> 
		
    <h1>About Barbara Nino Carreras</h1>
	<p> She is a Ph.d. candidate in the <a href="https://tip.itu.dk" target="_blank" >Technologies in Practice research group</a> at the IT University of Copenhagen. Her project explores how individuals from diverse backgrounds assist each other in navigating mandatory digital self-services in Denmark.</p>		  
	
	<h1>Wait, what is an alt-narrative?</h1>
	<p>The web allows us to show information in different modalities, through sound, imagery, text, and even haptic interactions! This is beneficial to many, especially disabled people.</p> 
		
	<p>Alt-text, or alternative text, is a written description, often in the form of code, that ensures blind, low vision, and neurodivergent folks have equal access to visual information.</p>
		
		<p>Alternative text, also known as alt-text, is a written description that ensures equal access to visual information for people who are blind, have low vision, or are neurodivergent. Alt-text is often seen as an additional and tedious task or a matter of accessibility compliance, which is unfortunate. However, alt-text is a remarkable and poetic medium. Researchers in the field of human-computer interaction have even developed a genre of alt-text known as Alt-Narratives.</p>	
		<p>We are going to give you some examples using Barbara's Macbook and VoiceOver (a built-in screen reader for Apple computers) with a synthethic computer voice called Kate.</p>

He takes pride in his work but encounters frustrated individuals who struggle to claim welfare benefits remotely. In addition to offering assisted digital access, he often provides emotional support as people get nervous and anxious about not being able to pay their bills or access health data on their computers.full stop.">

  	<img src="https://barbaraninocarreras.github.io/profile picture/illustrations_fieldwork_6.jpg" alt="A headline suspended in air reads as follow: “The Digital Drop-in Center provides attuned digital interactions with: respect, care work, remote access, mutual aid, and specialized social work.” Keywords enumerated across the image are highlighted in yellow. On the left of the drawing, we see Jeppe, who is sitting at his gamer station. On the screen, there are different people on a video call, presumably a Zoom or Teams meeting. People are sending hearts and smileys. One person in the meeting says via a speech bubble “Good morning Jeppe, so nice to see you, [heart emoji]). Jeppe replies smiling and waving his right hand away from the mouse: “Good morning, everybody!” A different sequence shows Jeppe as he smiles and tells us: “People using the digital drop-in center get me and I meet them from home, so it doesn’t matter that we live far away.” A sequence below shows Jeppe in a similar position, this time he is not smiling, and a darker shadow obscures his face as he shares with us, “I used to do drugs… Now I am clean, and I need a community to battle loneliness, people using the drop-in center are a huge support.the end.” ">

  	<img src="https://barbaraninocarreras.github.io/profile picture/Allan_1_.jpg" alt="Allan, a white man in his 60s, sits at an outdoor table. He wears a cap adorned with the Hus Forbi logo. He smokes a 
											   cigarette while his loyal companion, Fido, rests comfortably on his left side. Fido's attention is captivated by
											   the flight path of a butterfly, gracefully dancing around them and delicately vanishing. On the table, a cup of freshly brewed
											   coffee awaits. In Allan's left hand, a small device, a code display. Allan is conversing with Barbara and telling us: 
											   Before I had a telephone without internet, a friend helped me pay for a phone subscription. My phone number was connected to my
											   friend's information. I could not buy cheap tickets online. Recently, I got a smartphone, MITID, and a code reader. Maybe now I can
											   buy cheap train tickets from home? Friends who do not have a smartphone or a phone subscription must pay extra money to buy a cheap train ticket
											   at the station. The digital society is built in a way that makes life more expensive for people who are socially vulnerable.
											   Just look at how the banks deny a bank account and access to cash to vulnerable and elderly people. It is so dumb that politicians have created
											   a digital society without the involvement of civil society organizations. Politicians and the authorities are now more open to dialogue and
											   collaboration. This shift comes in late but gives us hope. It is always a problem of lack of involvement. Instead of asking what we need, 
											   we are forced to live in new ways. This is why it is crucial for me to attend public debates like the People's Meeting, so we can all live
											   self-determining and dignified lives. If you want to know more about the problems we have with banks, Hus Forbi has written an article about the
											   social bank. The organization GadeLiv has created their own bank solution while we wait for Danish banks to be held accountable 
											   for their discriminating practices. Allan calmly finishes his cigarrete while Fido falls asleep.The end.">

  	<img src="https://barbaraninocarreras.github.io/profile picture/Ann_h_1.jpg" alt="Hello, my name is Ann. I am 49 years old, although sometimes you might think I'm only 5. I am a bit child-like (laughs)
I am a plus-size woman with a little bit of everything. I have blue eyes, curly short hair, sometimes in a dark violet shade. My parents kindly forgot to give me a kick in the butt, so I stopped growing at around 1.67 cm.
I mostly wear jeans, either fitting snugly or currently the ones that are a bit loose from the calf down. And I just love when they have holes in them. As for tops, they can be in any color. I really like grass green, and violet/purple is my favorite color. But I am colorful, and the colors sometimes reflect my mood.
I also enjoy wearing dresses on certain days, depending on my mood, the wind, and the occasion.I appreciate humor in a sweet and non-hurtful way. I am empathetic and open-minded. And I love to talk and laugh.I hope this gives a little picture of who I am as a person. Now I will tell you a bit about how I use the digital drop-in center, a closed Facebook group for people who experience loneliness and social vulnerability.
Here, Barbara drew a picture of me working on my lithographs. I have created various floral patterns. Recently, I started volunteering as a teacher through video messenger, where I teach around 8 socially vulnerable individuals how to engage in lithography and other art forms like crochet. I have both visible and invisible disabilities, and my everyday life can be very challenging. Drawing provides me refuge, and I also enjoy writing. Here is an excerpt from my work:
Hope. I have discovered that I can still accomplish certain things, that knowledge remains valuable, and that my complex brain is not the only one in the world. I am perfect just the way I am, in my imperfect body.">
