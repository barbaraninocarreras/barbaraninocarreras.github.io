      <h1>Hello, thank you for joining us today.💞</h1>
  	 <p>Today Barbara will present her experimentations making comics and alt-narratives as a research method.</p> 
		
    <h1>About Barbara Nino Carreras</h1>
	<p> She is a Ph.d. candidate in the <a href="https://tip.itu.dk" target="_blank" >Technologies in Practice research group</a> at the IT University of Copenhagen. Her project explores how individuals from diverse backgrounds assist each other in navigating mandatory digital self-services in Denmark.</p>		  
	
	<h1>Wait, what is an alt-narrative?</h1>
	<p>The web allows us to show information in different modalities, through sound, imagery, text, and even haptic interactions! This is beneficial to many, especially disabled people.</p> 
		
	<p>Alt-text, or alternative text, is a written description, often in the form of code, that ensures blind, low vision, and neurodivergent folks have equal access to visual information.</p>
		
		<p>Alt-text is often perceived as an annoying extra task for many web content managers.This is very sad. Because alt-text is a wonderful poetic medium. Most importantly, it is a genre of writing that respects the diversity of ways in which we access information.</p>
		
		
		<p>We are going to give you some examples using Barbara's Macbook and VoiceOver (a built-in screen reader for Apple computers) with a synthethic computer voice called Kate.</p>

By the librarian, we see a white interpreter wearing a hijab. She translated the presentation from Danish to Arabic.">

The young woman appears perplexed while gazing at her phone. A 404 error message flashes on the screen. Her facial expression and hand gesture illustrate her confusion. She wonders, why is this municipality website designed so poorly">

  	<img src="https://barbaraninocarreras.github.iobarbaraninocarreras.github.io/profile picture/illustrations_fieldwork_6.jpg" alt="A headline suspended in air reads as follow: “The Digital Drop-in Center provides attuned digital interactions with respect, care work, remote access, mutual aid, and specialized social work.” Keywords enumerated across the image are highlighted in yellow. On the left of the drawing, we see Jeppe, who is sitting at his gamer station. On the screen, there are different people on a video call, presumably a Zoom or Teams meeting. People are sending hearts and smileys. One person in the meeting says via a speech bubble “Good morning Jeppe, so nice to see you, [heart emoji]). Jeppe replies smiling and waving his right hand away from the mouse: “Good morning, everybody!” A different sequence shows Jeppe as he smiles and tells us: “People using the digital drop-in center get me and I meet them from home, so it doesn’t matter that we live far away.” A sequence below shows Jeppe in a similar position, this time he is not smiling, and a darker shadow obscures his face as he shares with us, “I used to do drugs… Now I am clean, and I need a community to battle loneliness, people using the drop-in center are a huge support.” ">

  	<img src="https://barbaraninocarreras.github.io/profile picture/illustrations_fieldwork_2.jpg" alt="Jeppe, a man in his early 40s, sits at his gamer station attending a video call meeting with the authorities. I do not know Jeppe's race, I imagine him wearing a sailor-like t-shirt with stripes and plain blue jeans. He is distressed as he speaks to a public servant. I imagine the public servant to be a white middle-aged lady with glasses who sits in front of a large computer screen and – looks austere. Behind the screen there is a surreal image of a wave with claw-like edges that is about to devour Jeppe and his computer. The wave resembles a woodblock print called “Under the Wave off Kanagawa” by Japanese artist Hokusai. The lady on the screen says: “you must pay your television license debt” and Jeppe replies “but I sent extra documents”. Alongside this scene, there is three distinct panels organized vertically showing a close-up dialogue between Jeppe and the lady on the screen. The lady says, “here it shows you must pay”, her face, unfriendly. Jeppe looks worried and says “yes, but I have extra documents”. The lady appears again in the panel, which is divided in two triangles sharply separating her from Jeppe. She says, sorry, time is up, goodbye. Jeppe raises his eyebrows with despair and exclaims 'wait!'. The panel below shows in dark purple a close-up of the screen with the message “the meeting has ended”, Jeppe is looking at the screen feeling hopeless. The lady from the Debt agency hung up on him.">
