      <h1>Hello, thank you for joining us today.ðŸ’ž</h1>
  	 <p>Today Barbara will present you parts of her research exploring comics and alt-narratives</p> 
		
    <h1>About Barbara Nino Carreras</h1>
	<p> She is a Ph.d. candidate in the <a href="https://tip.itu.dk" target="_blank" >Technologies in Practice research group</a> at the IT University of Copenhagen. Her project explores how individuals from diverse backgrounds assist each other in navigating mandatory digital self-services in Denmark.</p>
	
			  
	<h1>Wait, what is an alt-narrative?</h1>
	<p>If you're new to disability culture, you may be interested in learning more about image descriptions. Alt-text, or alternative text, is a written description, often in the form of metadata, that enables blind, low vision, and neurodivergent folks, who use screen readers, to access and enjoy digital images. Check out the project <a href="https://alt-text-as-poetry.net">Alt-Text as Poetry</a> or the paper <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3491101.3516394">Exploring AltNarrative in HCI Imagery and Comics</a> by Makayla Lewis and colleagues (2022) to learn more about it. Typically, alt-text is hidden visually as metadata. On this site I write alt-text metadata and longer alt-narratives as captions to raise awareness about alt-text's narrative potential.</p>

 	<figcaption>Long image description/alt-narrative: as an ethnographer, I experiment with the making of comics and alternative text as a form of analysis.</figcaption>	
		<p>Collective forms of access emerge in relations of solidarity and mutual respect. In the context of welfare provision, I observe a kind of collective access politics that emerges as a response to inaccessible digital services and power assymetries between citizens and the state. My research is intended to inform digital policies and design approaches in the Nordic region so that the digitalization of welfare provision benefits minoritized and marginalized populations. </p>

She wonders, why is this municipality website designed so poorly">
