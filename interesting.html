They are assisting each other in organizing photos and important documents using Dropbox. One of them has been a volunteer at his local library since 2013, where he frequently assists senior citizens with limited digital skills in applying for welfare benefits online. He takes pride in his work but encounters frustrated individuals who struggle to claim welfare benefits remotely. In addition to offering assisted digital access, he often provides emotional support as people get nervous and anxious about not being able to pay their bills or access health data on their computers.full stop.">

On the left of the drawing, we see Jeppe, who is sitting at his gamer station. On the screen, there are different people on a video call, presumably a Zoom or Teams meeting. People are sending hearts and smileys. One person in the meeting says via a speech bubble “Good morning Jeppe, so nice to see you, [heart emoji]). Jeppe replies smiling and waving his right hand away from the mouse: “Good morning, everybody!” A different sequence shows Jeppe as he smiles and tells us: “People using the digital drop-in center get me and I meet them from home, so it doesn’t matter that we live far away.” A sequence below shows Jeppe in a similar position, this time he is not smiling, and a darker shadow obscures his face as he shares with us, “I used to do drugs… Now I am clean, and I need a community to battle loneliness, people using the drop-in center are a huge support.the end.” ">
