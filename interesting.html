      <h1>Hello, thank you for joining us today.💞</h1>
  	 <p>Today Barbara will present her experimentations making comics and alt-narratives as a research method.</p> 
		
    <h1>About Barbara Nino Carreras</h1>
	<p> She is a Ph.d. candidate in the <a href="https://tip.itu.dk" target="_blank" >Technologies in Practice research group</a> at the IT University of Copenhagen. Her project explores how individuals from diverse backgrounds assist each other in navigating mandatory digital self-services in Denmark.</p>		  
	
	<h1>Wait, what is an alt-narrative?</h1>
	<p>The web allows us to show information in different modalities, through sound, imagery, text, and even haptic interactions! This is beneficial to many, especially disabled people.</p> 
		
	<p>Alt-text, or alternative text, is a written description, often in the form of code, that ensures blind, low vision, and neurodivergent folks have equal access to visual information.</p>
		
		<p>Alt-text is often perceived as an annoying extra task or matter of accessibility compliance. This is very sad. Alt-text is a wonderful poetic medium. Researchers in the field of human-computer interaction have developed a genre of alt-text called Alt-Narratives.>
		
		<p>We are going to give you some examples using Barbara's Macbook and VoiceOver (a built-in screen reader for Apple computers) with a synthethic computer voice called Kate.</p>

They are assisting each other in organizing photos and important documents using Dropbox. One of them has been a volunteer at his local library since 2013, where he frequently assists senior citizens with limited digital skills in applying for welfare benefits online. He takes pride in his work but encounters frustrated individuals who struggle to claim welfare benefits remotely. In addition to offering assisted digital access, he often provides emotional support as people get nervous and anxious about not being able to pay their bills or access health data on their computers.">

The young woman appears perplexed while gazing at her phone. A 404 error message flashes on the screen. Her facial expression and hand gesture illustrate her confusion. She wonders, why is this municipality website designed so poorly">

On the left of the drawing, we see Jeppe, who is sitting at his gamer station. On the screen, there are different people on a video call, presumably a Zoom or Teams meeting. People are sending hearts and smileys. One person in the meeting says via a speech bubble “Good morning Jeppe, so nice to see you, [heart emoji]). Jeppe replies smiling and waving his right hand away from the mouse: “Good morning, everybody!” A different sequence shows Jeppe as he smiles and tells us: “People using the digital drop-in center get me and I meet them from home, so it doesn’t matter that we live far away.” A sequence below shows Jeppe in a similar position, this time he is not smiling, and a darker shadow obscures his face as he shares with us, “I used to do drugs… Now I am clean, and I need a community to battle loneliness, people using the drop-in center are a huge support.” ">
