 	<figcaption> Long image description/alt-narrative: self-portrait of Barbara made on an Ipad with Procreate on a photograph. Barbara is an an olive-skinned, 30-year-old, cis woman with brown eyes and brown hair. She has freckles on her nose. She wears earrings that resemble coral reefs. The earrings are made of green and pink plastic. She wears a knitted red scarf and a jacket that resembles a detective coat. Behind her, there's a Metacade in a hackerspace. The room feels like an underground artsy space. The light is bright.</figcaption>

	 <h1>Wait, what is an alt-narrative?</h1>
	<p>If you're new to disability culture, you may be interested in learning more about image descriptions. Alt-text, or alternative text, is a written description, often in the form of metadata, that enables blind, low vision, and neurodivergent folks, who use screen readers, to access and enjoy digital images. Check out the project <a href="https://alt-text-as-poetry.net">Alt-Text as Poetry</a> or the paper <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3491101.3516394">Exploring AltNarrative in HCI Imagery and Comics</a> by Lewis and colleagues to learn more about it. Typically, alt-text is hidden visually as metadata. On this site I write longer alt-narratives as captions to raise awareness about alt-text's narrative potential.</p>

 	<figcaption>Long image description/alt-narrative: Two happy elderly white men are staring at a computer screen while enjoying chocolates. They are assisting each other in organizing photos and important documents using Dropbox. One of them has been a volunteer at his local library since 2013, where he frequently assists senior citizens with limited digital skills in applying for welfare benefits online. He takes pride in his work but encounters frustrated individuals who struggle to claim welfare benefits remotely. In addition to IT support, he often provides emotional support as people get nervous and anxious about not being able to pay their bills or access health data on their computers.</figcaption>

    <h1>Current position</h1>
	<p>I am Ph.d. candidate in the Technologies in Practice research group at the IT University of Copenhagen. My project explores how individuals from diverse backgrounds assist each other in navigating mandatory digital self-services and infrastructures in Denmark to access government benefits or communicate with the public authorities.</p>
		
	<p>My research approach is intersectional. I am interested in amplifying and centering the lived experiences and knowledge of poor, queer, migrant, racialized and disabled folks most affected by inaccessible design and innovation. According to the Danish legal think tank Justitia, <a href="" target="_blank">20 per cent of the population</a> is underserved by mandatory digitalization in Denmark. As the authorities acknowledge, <a href="https://digst.dk/media/24389/digital-inklusion-i-det-digitaliserede-samfund.pdf" target="_blank">digital services today privilige resourceful and non-disabled individuals</a> and further marginalize poor, migrant, isolated, aging, and disabled populations. This situation calls for better policies and design approaches!</p>

 	<figcaption>Long image description/alt-narrative: A drawing depicts a plump, light-skinned cis woman with ADHD slaying a stylish bob hairstyle and bright, colorful clothing. The young woman appears perplexed while gazing at her phone. A 404 error message flashes on the screen. Her facial expression and hand gestures illustrate her confusion. She wonders "why is this municipality website designed so poorly?"</figcaption>

	<h2>Collective Access in welfare provision</h2>
	<p>I am interested in exploring different forms of collective access in digitalized versions of 
		provision. Collective forms of access emerge in relations of solidarity and mutual respect. In the context of welfare provision, I observe a kind of collective access politics that emerges as a response to inaccessible digital services and power assymetries between citizens and the state. My research is intended to inform digital policies and design approaches in the Nordic region so that the digitalization of welfare provision benefits minoritized and marginalized populations. </p>

 	<figcaption>Long image description/alt-narrative: As an ethnographer, I experiment with the making of comics and alternative text as a form of analysis. In this image, for instance, I draw on my fieldwork at a Danish public library (June 2021) to make sense of different forms of collective access. During my observations, I witnessed how library employees and volunteers of different ages, races, and nationalities assisted citizens, also of diverse backgrounds, with applying for welfare benefits online. A significant issue experienced by staff, volunteers, and citizens requesting help at the library was that welfare benefit applications online, such as those for housing subsidies, are often created for Danish-speaking individuals. This approach to digitalizing welfare services overlooks the needs of a diverse population that may need assistance to navigate online forms or who may find other languages more accessible. To address the lack of in-person support and multilingual content provided by the authorities, library staff fundraised the creation of IT support services at the library and also provided the services of interpreters speaking Danish, Spanish, Urdu, Arabic and Tigrinya, among other languages.</figcaption>

	<p>This project is financed by Nordforsk as a part of the Nordic research collaboration: <a href="https://www.nordforsk.org/projects/infrastructures-partially-digital-citizens-supporting-informal-welfare-work-digitized" target="_blank">Infrastructures for Partially Digital Citizens: Supporting Informal Welfare Work in the Digitized State.</a></p>

	  <h1>Research approach</h1>
    <p>I am committed to disability and climate justice. I am interested in creating relations of reciprocity and respect through participatory research projects. As a scholar drawing on theories from Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Anthropology, and Science and Technology Studies (STS), I advocate for community-led innovation and research driven by those most impacted by social injustice and inaccessibility.</p>
 
	<h1>Languages</h1>
    <p>My mother tongue is Spanish. I also work in English and Danish. I am learning Italian and also a bit of Danish Sign Language and Austrian Sign Language.</p>
