 	<figcaption> Self-portrait of Barbara made on an Ipad with Procreate on a photograph. Barbara is an an olive-skinned, 30-year-old, cis woman with brown eyes and brown hair. She has freckles on her nose. She wears earrings that resemble coral reefs. The earrings are made of green and pink plastic. She wears a knitted red scarf and a jacket that resembles a detective coat. Behind her, there's a Metacade in a hackerspace. The room feels like an underground artsy space. The light is bright.</figcaption>

	<h1>Research approach</h1>
    <p>I am committed to disability and climate justice. I am interested in creating relations of reciprocity and respect through participatory research projects. As a scholar drawing on theories from Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Anthropology, and Science and Technology Studies (STS), I advocate for community-led innovation and research driven by those most impacted by social injustice and inaccessibility.</p>

	</figure> 
    <p>I am Ph.d. candidate in the Technologies in Practice research group at the IT University of Copenhagen</p>
	 
	<p>My project investigates how people of different backgrounds help each other to use mandatory digital self-services and infrastructures in Denmark to access welfare benefits or to communicate with the public authorities. I am interested in exploring different forms of access from the perspective of citizens. As a researcher interested in qualitative methods and design, I am committed to equity and disability justice.</p>
