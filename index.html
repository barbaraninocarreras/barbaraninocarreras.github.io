   <p>User Research and Digital Accessibility</p>

    <h1>User Research</h1>
	<p>As an experienced user researcher committed to disability access, I identify diverse user needs and pains and assist designers in turning insights into valuable features and user experiences for a diverse population</p>

	<h2>Digital Accessibility</h2>
	<p> 30 percent of the population has one or more disabilities. As we age, many of us will likely acquire disabilities. Building accessible digital products, services and societies is essential for many and beneficial to all. I am passionate about making the digital world more accessible in collaboration with disabled people of different backgrounds and ages. </p>

 	<figcaption>Long image description/alt-narrative: as an ethnographer, I experiment with the making of comics and alternative text as a form of analysis. In this image, for instance, I draw on my fieldwork at a Danish public library (June 2021) to make sense of different forms of collective access. During my observations, I witnessed how library employees and volunteers of different ages, races, and nationalities helped citizens, also of diverse backgrounds, apply for welfare benefits online. A significant issue experienced by staff, volunteers, and citizens requesting help at the library was that welfare benefit applications online, such as those for housing subsidies, are created for Danish-speaking individuals who feel comfortable to communicate with the public authorities remotely. This approach to digitalizing welfare services overlooks the needs of a diverse population that may need assistance to navigate online forms or who may find other languages more accessible. To address the lack of in-person support and multilingual content provided by the public authorities, library staff fundraised the creation of IT support services at the library and also provided the services of interpreters speaking Danish, Spanish, Urdu, Arabic and Tigrinya, among other languages.</figcaption>

	 <h1>Wait, what is an alt-narrative?</h1>
	<p>If you're new to disability culture, you may be interested in learning more about image descriptions. Alt-text, or alternative text, is a written description, often in the form of metadata, that enables blind, low vision, and neurodivergent folks, who use screen readers, to access and enjoy digital images. Check out the project <a href="https://alt-text-as-poetry.net">Alt-Text as Poetry</a> or the paper <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3491101.3516394">Exploring AltNarrative in HCI Imagery and Comics</a> by Makayla Lewis and colleagues (2022) to learn more about it. Typically, alt-text is hidden visually as metadata. On this site I write alt-text metadata and longer alt-narratives as captions to raise awareness about alt-text's narrative potential.</p>

 	<figcaption>Long image description/alt-narrative: a drawing depicts a plump, light-skinned cis woman with ADHD slaying a stylish bob hairstyle and bright, colorful clothing. The young woman appears perplexed while gazing at her phone. A 404 error message flashes on the screen. Her facial expression and hand gesture illustrate her confusion. She wonders, "why is this municipality website designed so poorly?"</figcaption>

	  <h1>Research approach</h1>
    <p>I am committed to disability and climate justice. I am interested in creating relations of reciprocity and respect through participatory research projects. As a scholar drawing on theories from Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Anthropology, and Science and Technology Studies (STS), I advocate for community-led innovation and research driven by those most impacted by social injustice and inaccessibility.</p>
 
	<h1>Languages</h1>
    <p>My mother tongue is Spanish. I also work in English and Danish. I am learning Italian and a bit of Danish Sign Language and Austrian Sign Language.</p>
