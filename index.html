    <h1>User Research</h1>
	<p>I am an experienced user researcher committed to disability access. I identify diverse user needs and pains and assist designers in turning insights into valuable features and user experiences for a diverse population.</p>

	<h2>Digital Accessibility</h2>
	<p>According to the <a href="https://www.un.org/">United Nations</a>, 10 percent of the world's population has one or more disabilities. As we age, many of us will likely acquire disabilities. Building accessible digital products and services is essential for many and beneficial to all. I am passionate about making the digital world more accessible in collaboration with disabled people of different backgrounds and ages.</p>

	<p>This project is financed by Nordforsk as a part of the Nordic research collaboration: <a href="https://www.nordforsk.org/projects/infrastructures-partially-digital-citizens-supporting-informal-welfare-work-digitized" target="_blank">Infrastructures for Partially Digital Citizens: Supporting Informal Welfare Work in the Digitized State.</a></p>
		
	 <h1>User Experience and Digital Accessibility an Innovative Pathway to more Sustainable Digital Societies</h1>
	<p>In an increasingly digital world, prioritizing disability access in design from the outset is crucial. Neglecting accessibility comes with significant financial and social costs. European regulations now mandate public and private organizations to prioritize digital accessibility. Instead of viewing these regulations as burdensome, I perceive them as an opportunity for innovative and socially just design. By incorporating the insights of disabled users and designers, we can create digital products and services that not only anticipate disable people as users, but celebrate disability identity and culture.</p>

 	<figcaption>Long image description/alt-narrative: a drawing depicts a plump, light-skinned cis woman with ADHD slaying a stylish bob hairstyle and bright, colorful clothing. The young woman appears perplexed while gazing at her phone. A 404 error message flashes on the screen. Her facial expression and hand gesture illustrate her confusion. She wonders, "why is this municipality website designed so poorly?"</figcaption>
